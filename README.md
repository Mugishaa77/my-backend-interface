# my-backend-interface
Backend repository of evergreen farms limited 

What it contains:
Here, user data from the input collected from the forms is entered and sent to a database, MongoDB through APIs.
The login and authentication process is also coordinated between the backend and front-end repositories through APIs.
I have not yet found a hosting site that suits my needs, any contribution will be appreciated.
More information will be updated as I continue working on the project. 
Thankyou for your time.
